## Introduction
Representing complex 3D objects as simple geometric primitives, known as shape abstraction, is important for geometric modeling, structural analysis, and shape synthesis. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised shape abstraction method to map a point cloud into a compact cuboid representation. We jointly predict cuboid allocation as part segmentation and cuboid shapes and enforce the consistency between the segmentation and shape abstraction for self-learning. For the cuboid abstraction task, we transform the input point cloud into a set of parametric cuboids using a variational auto-encoder network. The segmentation network allocates each point into a cuboid considering the point-cuboid affinity. In addition, several novel losses are designed to jointly supervise the two branches in terms of geometric similarity and cuboid compactness.
